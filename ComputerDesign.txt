Practice or preview Verilog on your own before taking this course if you have chance. Ability to get feedback
on the practicals in the lab.  Content was interesting and the coursework was a great way to enhance the
overall understanding of the study material. The exercise sheets and provided answers were also very helpful,
since they gave an idea of potential exam questions. The lecturer is very good at explaining the content and
was really helpful during labs - sometimes stayed well beyond the lab finish time to help us with the
coursework. Overall, a really good course and one of the best lecturers I have had at uni so far.
Excellent lecturer, very clear and explained things extremely well, both in lectures and tutorials.
Interesting and engaging course. More lab sessions with instructors present. I would suggest to have more
lab assistants during the lab session. For now, only one TA (sometimes with our lecturer) will be around,
which seemed not sufficient for a class with lots of questions to ask. Both the lecturer and the tutor are
helpful during the whole course. They provided us lots of valuable advice and suggestions on our project and
coursework.
