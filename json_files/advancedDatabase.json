        "Dr Paolo Guagliardo is great at explaining the material clearly. He also always pays attention whether the Media Hopper camera is on. This is really helpful if missed some lectures and also for the revision for the exam since, unfortunately, there are no pdf slides for this course. However, the course material is in alignment with the course book, which also gives nice explanations. Be aware this course is not about manipulating data in database but rather about the implementation of database management system (e.g. how dbms fetches data from a disk or various types of indexing). Coursework covered actual material of the course.",
        "Quality course, interesting material, well taught, would recommend.",
        "Clear explanation of how database works",
        "Dr Paolo Guagliardo explained everything very clearly and he always has examples prepared in advanced. Nice coursework which covered a great part of actual material of the course.",
        " Dr Paolo is a very good teacher, he explains everything very clearly and thoroughly. I liked him not having any slides, but rather using a small white board for the lectures.",
        "The lecture explain every knowledge point quite clear.",
        "The lecturer really seemed to care about the quality of his teaching, and it fully paid off",
        "The lectures are good.",
        "Have recommended readings to go along with lectures or course notes as currently the lectures are all done on the board with no lecture slides or anything to reinforce what you have seen in the lectures. Going back through lecture slides is a good way to revise but as there is no slides for this class, you would have to go and rewatch all the lectures which is much more time consuming.",
        "The lecturer wrote everything on the whiteboard. Although everything he wrote is on the recordings, it would be nice to have some slides. As mentioned above, Dr Paolo Guagliardo had always examples already prepared, so maybe he could make a pdf version of them in advance.",
        "Would be nice to have an outline of topics covered/ to be covered, with corresponding chapters from the textbook",
        "There was meant to be tutorials but the lecturer did not have rooms/times sorted to begin with and then they got cancelled due to the strikes so we only got 1 tutorial instead of 4 which is not good as I find tutorials to be very useful in preparing for the exam.The one tutorial we did have was very useful.",
        "There were supposed to be (only) 4 tutorials for the course. First one did not happen because of some organisation mistake made by ITO. Then, next two of them were cancelled due to the union strike and bad weather. Consequently, there was only one tutorial throughout the course. Unfortunately, I could not attend it but it was recorded."
