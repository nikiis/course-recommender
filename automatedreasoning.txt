I would recommend it, as long as you're prepared to sit down and spend some time making sure you know how to
use Isabelle.  IT'S A PAINFUL COURSE, DON'T DO IT UNLESS YOU REALLY LIKE ASSISTED THEOREM PROVING AND LOGIC
This course will be painful, if you are not interested in Logic, Math and programming. Honestly, don't take it,
unless you are interested in those three. However, if you are, this is possibly the best course for you.
Work constantly on the material as its being taught and make sure you understand and try to solve all the
tutorial questions. That way you will not find any problem dealing with the course. Otherwise you might
struggle with it, especially with the coursework.  Worth the challenge. An opportunity to see how logic can be
formalised and used in an interactive programming context, and to see the potential applications for this.
It really stimulated my interest in logic and I was really disinterested before. Such a great course.
The content was very well taught and the tutorials were perfect to reinforce it. The coursework was
challenging and satisfactory to work on.  The mental gymnastics required. Can't think of anything! Maybe some
more basic Isar and Isabelle introductory examples to get faster the grip with the tools. The learning curve
for Isabelle is quite steep, but I suppose there isn't really any getting around this, other than to make sure that Isabelle proof tactics and syntax (for example) aren't rushed through, and that students are supported well especially when Isabelle is introduced.  I found the software (Isabelle) extremely difficult to use and the available documentation almost impenetrable - to me it seemed written by experts for experts, even those that were apparently aimed at beginners. Imogen was very helpful in labs.Tutorials were challenging, but in a good way.
